# Functions::wireCount()

Source: `wire/core/Functions.php`

Return the count of item(s) present in the given value

Duplicates behavior of PHP count() function prior to PHP 7.2, which states:

> Returns the number of elements in $value. When the parameter is neither an array nor an
object with implemented Countable interface, 1 will be returned. There is one exception,
if $value is NULL, 0 will be returned.


@param mixed $value

@return int
