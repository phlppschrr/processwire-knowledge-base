- Returned URLs do not include additional URL segments or pagination numbers.
- Returned URLs are indexed by language name, i.e. “default”, “fr”, “es”, etc.
- If multi-language URLs not installed, then index is just “default”.
- Past URLs are indexed by language; then ISO-8601 date, i.e. “default;2016-08-11T07:44:43-04:00”,
  where the date represents the last date that URL was considered current.
- If PagePathHistory core module is not installed then past/historical URLs are excluded.
- You can disable past/historical or multi-language URLs by using the $options argument.
