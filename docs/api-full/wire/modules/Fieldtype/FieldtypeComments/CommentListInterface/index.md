## Summary

ProcessWire CommentListInterface and CommentList

CommentListInterface defines an interface for CommentLists.
CommentList provides the default implementation of this interface.

Use of these is not required. These are just here to provide output for a FieldtypeComments field.
Typically you would iterate through the field and generate your own output. But if you just need
something simple, or are testing, then this may fit your needs.
