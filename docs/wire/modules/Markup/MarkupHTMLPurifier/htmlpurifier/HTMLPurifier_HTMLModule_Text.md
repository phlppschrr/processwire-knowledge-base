# HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule_Text

Source: `wire/modules/Markup/MarkupHTMLPurifier/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier.standalone.php`

XHTML 1.1 Text Module, defines basic text containers. Core Module.
@note In the normative XML Schema specification, this module
      is further abstracted into the following modules:
         - Block Phrasal (address, blockquote, pre, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
         - Block Structural (div, p)
         - Inline Phrasal (abbr, acronym, cite, code, dfn, em, kbd, q, samp, strong, var)
         - Inline Structural (br, span)
      This module, functionally, does not distinguish between these
      sub-modules, but the code is internally structured to reflect
      these distinctions.
