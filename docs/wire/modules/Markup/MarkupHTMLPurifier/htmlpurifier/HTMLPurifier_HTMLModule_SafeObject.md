# HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule_SafeObject

Source: `wire/modules/Markup/MarkupHTMLPurifier/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier.standalone.php`

A "safe" object module. In theory, objects permitted by this module will
be safe, and untrusted users can be allowed to embed arbitrary flash objects
(maybe other types too, but only Flash is supported as of right now).
Highly experimental.
