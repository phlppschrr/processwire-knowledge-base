## Lister Pro


### A powerful new way to browse and manage your pages

ListerPro enables you to find, filter, list *and* manipulate pages based on any of their properties. It presents an AJAX-driven table of matching pages and you have full, dynamic control over what columns are displayed in the table, and their order. Unlike the regular Lister, ListerPro enables you to create your own custom Listers, perform manipulations on pages, customize to your heart's desire, and much more. ListerPro is a truly unique, powerful and easy-to-use tool that will significantly enhance the way you work with ProcessWire.
