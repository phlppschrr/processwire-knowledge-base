## Roadmap for ProcessWire in 2016

1 January 2016 by Ryan Cramer [ 8 Comments](/blog/posts/happy-new-year-heres-a-roadmap-for-processwire-in-2016/#comments)


## Happy New Year!

Hope that you are having a great 2016 so far and thanks for being here! In this post, we're going to take a look at what's planned for ProcessWire in 2016. This is our proposed roadmap for 2016. Nothing here is fixed or final and–as always–we're likely to pursue more than just what's here, but we think it's a good start. We encourage you to reply and tell us what you think too.


## The ProcessWire core in 2016

As many of you reading this already know, ProcessWire 3.0 is already pretty far along, and some of us are even using it in production now (like this site). Lets start out by revisiting what the biggest additions to ProcessWire 3.0 are so far (already in place).


### What’s in ProcessWire 3.0


### What’s still coming for the first release of ProcessWire 3.0

We've also got more on the way for ProcessWire 3.0. The following are not yet on the devns branch (or are only partially there), but are currently in progress and will be there soon.


### What else is coming for ProcessWire 3.x in 2016

Everything mentioned above is what's going to be in the first master version of ProcessWire 3.0, but we've also got a lot more planned for ProcessWire 3.x in 2016, here's a few things that are planned for this year. One or more of these may also find their way into the first master release of 3.0.

`for(var page in wire.pages.find('template=product')) { ... }`


### What’s coming for ProcessWire 2.x in 2016

While 2016 will be the year of ProcessWire 3, we still plan to continue maintaining the 2.x branch of ProcessWire in 2016. The focus will largely be on stability, performance and security optimizations, as well as fixes for issues as they are reported. Since the focus is stability, there won't likely be many new features added beyond what's already there.

While there aren't currently plans to have a 2.8 version of ProcessWire, there are plans to release several more 2.7 versions. There is no planned EOL for PW 2.7 at present, so support and updates will likely continue through all of 2016.

Our 2.7 branch is intended to be so solid and stable that you can upload a website running on it, and then not have to touch it again (if you don't want to) for the life of the site. Though the same could be said for most versions of ProcessWire. I'm a little embarrassed to admit I even have some sites still running on ProcessWire 1.x!


## What’s coming for the Pro modules in 2016

Thank you for supporting ProcessWire with the [Pro modules](/store/), it is greatly appreciated, and it is what enables ProcessWire to be a sustainable project. 2016 is going to be an exciting year for the Pro modules and we have a lot planned. Here is a taste of a few things currently on our todo list for 2016.


### Lots of planned upgrades for the Pro modules

All of the other Pro modules will likely receive upgrades as well. All the Pro modules will also be available in PW 3.x-specific versions once ProcessWire 3.0 is the new master. Though all of the current Pro modules already work with ProcessWire 3.0 thanks to PW's built in module compiler. While we don't have specific features to mention here for all of of the Pro modules just yet, we encourage registered users to always keep an eye out in the relevant support boards for upgrades.


## Stepping outside the code: PW project goals for 2016

While we've got a lot of plans for ProcessWire the *product*, we've also got a lot of bigger picture goals for ProcessWire as a project. After all, ProcessWire is much more than just a product… at its heart, it's a community of web developers and designers dedicated to helping each other and striving for excellence in everything. Consistent with this, here are a few bigger picture goals for ProcessWire beyond just the product.


### Increase the visibility of ProcessWire in the web development world

We need more exposure via external articles, links, social network activity and more. We also need high profile projects (many of which I've become aware of recently) to stop keeping their use of ProcessWire a secret. We'll get into more details about this next week, and get into more specifics about how you can help.


### Delegate the core (and more) to a broader team

ProcessWire may have started as a single developer project, but it will continue to grow more and more as a team project. With ProcessWire 3.0 and in 2016, we're going to have more dedicated maintainers for individual parts in the core and ProcessWire network of sites.

You already know that Tom Reno (Renobird) leads the design and development of the Reno admin theme. And you might know that Horst has been developing and maintaining our API-side image manipulation functions for quite some time. Those are just examples of a few people already involved in ProcessWire's core. Going forward, there will be more people involved in leading and maintaining the development of other modules in the core. LostKobrakai has already started leading development with our images field, and Renobird is leading design. We hope to have this in the core soon!

You'll see more and more examples like this. In 2016, the team will also gain more visibility on our site where you can learn more about each of them and what they do. The core team is not just those dealing with code or design, but those maintaining the project in other ways too, like with the forums, website, management of modules, cheatsheet, sites directory, developer directory, and more.


### Redesign of ProcessWire.com and forum upgrades

Our current site and design have served us well over the last few years, but we're reaching the point where a redesign is in order. We're not yet sure of the full scope of this or who will be involved, but it's definitely on our mind as a goal for 2016. Tell us what you'd like to see in the redesign, we always value your feedback in all areas.

In 2016 we are also hoping to upgrade our forums to a new version of IP.Board (4) which will provide a major leap in UI and function, as well as improvements to the store.


### Continued and greater focus on documentation and tutorials

Documentation is one of the most important parts of supporting our community and developers using ProcessWire. It's also key in attracting new users. We will continue to focus on improving our documentation, tutorials and anything related that assists developers using ProcessWire. We've still got some holes to fill in terms of documentation, and we've also got improvements and upgrades to make in some existing documentation sections.

Time spent on writing and improving documentation and tutorials is always time well spent. We aim to make ours the best and most complete available for any CMS/CMF.


### Continued weekly blog posts and more guest posts

For more than a year now, we've had weekly blog posts, many accompanied by new incremental PW versions. They have become an important part of our communication with ProcessWire users. We aim to continue that in 2016. Some of our most popular posts have been from guest authors like Antti Peisa and Tom Reno. So we'll make sure to get you even more of those this year too!

Thank you for being here and reading what we write!
