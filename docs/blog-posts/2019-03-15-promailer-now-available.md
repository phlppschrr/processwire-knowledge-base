## ProcessWire ProMailer now available

15 March 2019 by Ryan Cramer [ 0 Comments](/blog/posts/promailer-now-available/#comments)

This week ProcessWire ProMailer has been released, plus we’ve got a nice upgrade in our community support forum, and more.

I’m happy to report that ProcessWire ProMailer is now available. Most of the content I’ve written this week isn’t in this blog post, but rather on new pages for ProMailer. Rather than repeating that content here, I'll link to those pages below. As a result, this post will be a bit short. After working on it for a few months, I’m really happy with how ProMailer has turned out. If you have any questions about the product, please feel free to send me a PM in the forums. Here’s some more information about ProMailer:

- [ProMailer product info](/store/pro-mailer/)
- [ProMailer manual and user guide](/store/pro-mailer/manual/)

The product is currently in beta. If you are interested in ProMailer but don’t want to use it while in beta, wait a week or so till the product page indicates it is no longer in beta. But if you would like to get it now, there's a good discount available. Use coupon code PWPMBETA which gives a $20 discount (like we’ve done for other beta Pro modules in the past). Thank you for your support with Pro modules, as this is what enables the ongoing development of ProcessWire.

I mentioned in a previous post that ProMailer would be available to ProDevTools users, as the original plan was to make it part of the [ProDevTools package.](https://processwire.com/store/pro-dev-tools/) During development the scope expanded quite a bit and it was better to make it an independent product. However, since it’s already been promised, a copy of ProMailer will still be provided to existing ProDevTools subscribers upon request. If you have an active ProDevTools subscription, send me a PM in the forums and I will get you setup with a copy. If you previously had ProDevTools but no longer have an active support/subscription, and would like to renew it, please contact me as well.

Because it took the whole week to get ProMailer ready for release, I wasn’t able to cover many issue reports this week. (Releasing a new module always takes longer than I expect). Next week I’ll be back to resolving issue reports, and as mentioned in [last week's update](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/21012-weekly-update-for-march-8-2019/), the plan is to cover them all, no matter how many weeks it takes, as we’ve got great momentum and help from the community.

This week we also got a major [forum upgrade](https://processwire.com/talk/) thanks to Pete. In addition to the forum upgrade, Pete also updated the forums for the new website design and he did a great job with this, it already feels like home. Big thanks to Pete! While Pete was doing that, I updated the ProcessWire Weekly [email newsletter](/community/newsletter/subscribe/) template for the new theme as well. So newsletter subscribers will see the new look and feel in future editions.

While there’s no new core version this week on the dev branch, there are a few improvements that have been committed the the core, and a few in progress as well (to appear next week) along with the continued resolution of issue reports. More on all of that next week. Till then, I hope you have a great weekend and enjoy reading the [ProcessWire Weekly](https://weekly.pw) for the latest news and updates!
