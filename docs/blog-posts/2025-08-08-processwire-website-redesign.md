## ProcessWire website redesign

8 August 2025 by Ryan Cramer [ 3 Comments](/blog/posts/processwire-website-redesign/#comments)

This week I’m thrilled to report that we have a new website online. The site was designed by Jan Ploch and Diogo Oliveira of [KONKAT Studio](https://konkat.studio) in Hamburg Germany.

I think that Jan and Diogo did an amazing job with the site. They put a ton of work into it, generously donating their time and skills to support the project, for all of us. Just like they did with the admin theme.

This is the 4th iteration of the ProcessWire website since 2010. To me, the new design evokes content management and computing both in the past and the future… classic and modern at the same time. A timeless design as an ideal way to communicate what we’ve always intended as a timeless tool, ProcessWire.

Interesting: 80% of ProcessWire's traffic comes from desktop browsers, and only 20% from mobile browsers. For many sites today, it is the opposite.

Jan and Diogo also designed our new admin theme, and the new site is designed to share some of the same design language. When we have screenshots of the admin on the website, it fits right in with everything else, as an example. This is first time that we've had such a nice brand similarity between the website and admin.

I think that the [homepage](/) in particular really does a good job of communicating ProcessWire to new users, and gives a much needed facelift to the project’s public appearance. Navigating deeper, the entire site gives me the feeling that the O’Reilly books filling my bookshelf do, which is the highest compliment I can give (I'm a huge fan of O'Reilly books).

Jan of KONKAT Studio is the author of the ProcessWire module [PAGEGRID](https://page-grid.com/), “a flexible drag-and-drop page builder with exceptional design control.” And in my opinion, a truly amazing module that all ProcessWire users should know about.

I worked on the development side of the new site, and while I’m not sure I’ve got it pixel-perfect with the design yet, it was close enough that I didn’t want to make our users wait any longer. I haven’t yet fully optimized the site either, and I need to so some clean up on the CSS as well. I'll be continuing to work on a few details. If you find anything that doesn’t seem like it’s displaying quite right, it's my fault, so please let me know.

With apologies to the designers, I also deviated from the original design in a couple of spots (like the white box above that's a little wider than the column, if your screen is wide). So some things might change, I'll let the designers decide what the final output will be.

A huge thank to Jan and Diogo of KONKAT Studio for this awesome redesign of the ProcessWire website! They are both offline right now traveling to different places, so they aren’t yet here to communicate about it, but my hope is that we can have a Q&A with them about the new site in our next blog post. Thanks for reading and I hope that you enjoy our new website!
