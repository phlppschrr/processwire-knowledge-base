### What comes next?

Whenever a new version is merged to the master branch, there are suddenly a lot more people using it. In addition, our master branch gets picked up by Bitnami, Softaculous, AMPPS and others. All in all, there is the potential for millions of installations.

When the audience size makes a major jump like that, we are always on the lookout for new issues. If you run into any issues, please be sure to report them. Typically there will be 1-3 more releases making minor tweaks in the first couple weeks of a new release, as there have been in past major version releases. For instance, ProcessWire’s last master version (2.5) settled in at 2.5.3.

However, there’s no reason to wait–start enjoying ProcessWire 2.6 now. This version has already been in broader use [as dev versions] than many of our past master versions, so we feel great about the stability and quality of ProcessWire 2.6. If you've been using 2.5.3 or an older version, you are in for a real treat with ProcessWire 2.6!

In the last couple of weeks we’ve really tried to limit any code changes to the core that would require more testing, unless anything critical came up (it didn’t). To limit these changes and be able to prepare a well tested release, we’ve had to delay requested tweaks, minor issue reports and feature requests temporarily. But we’ll be getting back to those as usual on our dev branch in the coming weeks, so thank you for your continued involvement and support–keep at it!


### New documentation section on securing ProcessWire installations

This week we added a new section to our documentation on [securing your ProcessWire installation](/blog/categories/security/). This includes articles on securing file permissions, securing your admin, web hosting security considerations, migrating development to production, and more. Please check it out and let us know what you think. If there is anything you think we should add or change, we’d like to hear that too.

When upgrading existing sites to ProcessWire 2.6, it’s a perfect time to look at the security of your ProcessWire installations, particularly if running in shared hosting environments. Recently I was assisting someone with their PW installation and discovered along the way that their /site/assets/ and /site/config.php file permissions were not secure enough for the shared hosting environment that they were in. It made me think some of these topics needed more thorough coverage in our documentation.

If you are running in a non-dedicated environment, please read through the [securing file permissions](/docs/security/file-permissions/) section and double check that your security is as good as it can be in your environment. While focused on security, look into [securing your admin with https](/docs/security/admin/#install-an-ssl-certificate-and-require-https-for-your-admin), installing [database sessions](/docs/security/sessions/), checking for upgrades of installed modules, and [removing](/docs/security/third-party-modules/) any 3rd party modules that are no longer in use.
