### Admin theme framework updates

Just a quick update for you this week. Much of the focus went towards continuing work on the new admin theme we've discussed over the last few weeks. This week, some more layout options have been added to it that I think many may find useful. Lots of small details and tweaks have been getting attention as well. But I'm a little short on time this afternoon, so rather than try to describe everything, I made another screencast:

These updates are available now in the current [AdminThemeUikit](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/AdminThemeUikit) module. Note however that you'll need core version 3.0.57, also released today. This core version doesn't contain any new features per se, but does contain several adjustments to support new features in our admin theme framework. Hope that you all have a great weekend and enjoy reading the [ProcessWire Weekly](http://weekly.pw)!
