## ProcessWire 2018 Roadmap

## Roadmap

The ProcessWire roadmap is an evolving document that we update every year around this time. It reflects the current list of priorities for the ProcessWire project in the coming year and years ahead. During most years, we complete many (though not all) items from the roadmap. We don't limit ourselves to the roadmap either, as many items that weren't on the roadmap are completed too. The focus often depends on what resources are available in any given week, and what the most immediate needs are for current projects and clients. In that respect, we expect 2018 will be similar to years past. Meaning, we expect to cover a lot of territory with what's mentioned here, and much more.


### What we did in 2017

Before we look look at our list for 2018, lets first look at what we did in 2017. We released around 40 versions of ProcessWire on the dev branch, and two versions on the 3.x master branch. We also completed these items from the roadmap:

- Introduced a new admin theme to the core (AdminThemeUikit).
- Upgrades to our image/photo tools and client-side image resize support.
- Improved file/image fields with improved tagging support.
- Tools for exporting and importing pages.
- Added drag-drop image support in CKEditor.
- Introduced more multi-language fields.
- Added support for markup regions.
- Continued upgrades to Pro modules.
- Added repeater support in ProDrafts.

Beyond what was on the roadmap, we also added the following in 2017:

- Improvements to admin theme navigation (like page tree in dropdowns).
- Most of the Pro modules received significant version upgrades.
- Moved ProcessWire.com to run on AWS ([more](/blog/posts/amazon-aws-now-powering-processwire.com-sites/))
- Published upgrades to our core API reference site.
- Added a lot of new core API methods and hooks.
- Continued major upgrades to our Repeater fields.
- Released new ProFields module: [FieldtypeFunctional](/blog/posts/functional-fields/).
- Released new [Login for Facebook](/blog/posts/pw-login-for-facebook/) and [Login Register](/blog/posts/pw-3.0.76-plus-login-register/) modules.
- Released new ProFields module for managing Fieldsets: [FieldtypeFieldsetGroup](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.73-and-new-fieldset-types/).
- Added a new core module for managing Fieldsets: [FieldsetPage](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.74-adds-new-fieldsetpage-field-type/).
- Introduced significant upgrades to the [core Role editor](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.81-upgrades-the-role-editor/).
- Major improvements to our [Password field](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.83-core-updates/).
- Major upgrade to our [installer](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.84-core-updates/).
- Upgrades to management of [user profile screen](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.84-core-updates/#user-profile-updates).
- Added support for more [field/template context](/blog/posts/pw-3.0.87/) configuration.
- Introduced major upgrades to the software that powers our support forum and store (IP.Board, thanks to Pete).
- And much more... see our [blog posts over the last year](/blog/) for all the details.

Beyond the core, there are plans to release upgrades for most of the Pro modules, as well as several non-Pro modules, like LoginRegister, ProcessWireUpgrade and others. We'd also like to hear from you all about what you'd like to see in 2018 for ProcessWire, and in the years ahead. Have a great weekend and enjoy the [ProcessWire Weekly](http://weekly.pw) which also recently posted a [great 2017 recap in issue 190](https://weekly.pw/issue/190/). Thanks for reading!
