## ProcessWire 3.0.18

Version 3.0.18 continues from [last week](/blog/posts/major-images-field-upgrade/), making major upgrades to our images field. This week we got into some of the finer details, and we've got plenty for you to look at here, as well as a screencast (at the end) to demonstrate it all.


### More image field upgrades


### What else?

The current feature set will be the full scope of the images field before the master release of ProcessWire 3.0. But there have also been an overwhelming number of different feature requests so we'll no doubt be looking closer at some of these on the next round of updates.

Because we've added so much here in these last few weeks, we're going to focus on making sure everything we already have is solid and running smoothly before we add too much more to the images field. But we'd definitely like to explore some more things like custom crop features, more custom meta data fields and image editing tools when we get into ProcessWire 3.1. Thank you for all the interest in the images field!


### Screenshots

Regular gride mode. Note the addition of a slider (for thumbnail size) and links for grid mode, proportional grid mode, and list mode in the header.

Here's what proportional grid mode looks like:

List mode lets you edit all images at the same time:


### Screencast

This screencast (no sound) demonstrates the new images field, including features added this week, as well as features added last week.
