## Short update with ProcessWire 3.0.62 master

12 May 2017 by Ryan Cramer [ 2 Comments](/blog/posts/pw-3.0.62-master/#comments)

This week has been a short one for development time, so I don't have anything particularly interesting to report in terms of new core updates or modules. I was out of town part of the week, and now my wife is traveling for this week and next–I'm responsible for the kids, and they take priority. :)

We returned this week from New York City where we did the [Five Boro Bike Tour](http://www.bike.nyc/events/td-five-boro-bike-tour/). We were able to do this thanks to the great people at [Tripsite](https://www.tripsite.com), who also use ProcessWire. They do this bike tour every year ([photos from last year](https://www.tripsite.com/blog/posts/tripsite-does-five-boro-bike-tour-2016/)), and I can [see why](https://www.tripsite.com/bike/tours/nyc-5-boro-bike-tour/). It's a 64 km/40 mile (more than 80 km in our case) bike ride through all the major regions of NYC, and there are about 33000 bike riders. This was the 40th year of the Five Boro Bike Tour. They close down all the roads you ride on, and it really is an incredible experience. My wife and I actually hadn't ridden our bikes in at least 5 years, so our bodies weren't prepared for that much biking, but as it turned out we made it through just fine. Thankfully it's not a race, it was a great time, and we can't wait to do it again.

This week I've merged the dev branch to master, for master version 3.0.62. This fixes a few minor bugs that were in 3.0.61. This coming week I'll be working on the dev branch version 3.0.63, though not likely to have major updates since I'll be taking care of kids more than usual this coming week as well.

There's also a new version of the [AdminThemeUikit](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/AdminThemeUikit) module present in the Github repo this week. I believe we're now at the point where others can start working with this module on the design side. While Uikit 3 is still technically beta, it seems to be quite solid at this point. If anyone is working with this module, I'd be really interested in seeing what you come up with.

Thanks and hope that you all have a great weekend. Check in with the [ProcessWire Weekly](http://weekly.pw) tomorrow as well.
