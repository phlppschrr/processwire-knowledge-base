## Checklist

- Multiple language support with ProcessWire: Multi-language page names (URLs) and multi-language text fields make developing a multilingual site as easy as developing a single language site
- Code Internationalization (i18n): This page provides detailed documentation on everything you need to know to make your template files or modules translatable using ProcessWire's translation tools
- Using multi-language fields: Here we look in detail at multi-language fields and language-alternate fields, as well as how to use them. Also includes a video overview and examples of how to use language fields to create full multi-language websites
- Multi-language URLs and page names: Multi-language URLs and page names enable you to maintain different/translated URLs for each page, based on the language. It also lets you produce your site easily, as the language is determined automatically by the URL
- Add multi-language translations to your module: To add multi-language translations to your module, you can export a CSV file of translations, give them names that reflect the language and copy them to /languages/ directory in your module’s files. We'll cover the details in 4 steps below
