## Core Concepts

- Pages: Almost everything in ProcessWire is represented by a Page. The term “Page” refers to a webpage, though in ProcessWire it’s also much more.
- Templates: Every Page has a template which defines the type of Page and what fields are present on pages using it. Every template may be used by one or more pages.
- Fields: Fields in ProcessWire are where the content is actually stored. Any field may be one of many storing content for a Page and its output.
