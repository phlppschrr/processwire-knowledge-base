## Summary

Click the Install button. Database-driven sessions will be enabled immediately, which means you are immediately logged out. Simply log back in, and your system is now using database-driven sessions.As a bonus, you can now monitor live traffic on your site from Setup > Sessions. If you want the information present on this screen to include IP address and/or user agent, enable these options from the Session Handler Database module configuration screen.
