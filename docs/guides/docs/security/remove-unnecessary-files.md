ProcessWire comes with several files that you will no longer need after installation.

The installer gives you the opportunity to remove these automatically, but if you didn't let it, or if it was unable to for some reason, you should remove them yourself. In either case, double check that these files/directories are removed after installation:

- /install.php
- /site-default/
- /site-languages/
- /site-beginner/
- /site-blank/
- /site-classic/
- /site/install/

If you have any 3rd party modules installed that are no longer in use, uninstall and erase them from the file system.
