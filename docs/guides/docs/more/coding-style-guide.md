# ProcessWire PHP Coding Style Guide v1.0

Source: https://processwire.com/docs/more/coding-style-guide/

## Summary

This PHP style guide represents the coding style preferred for the ProcessWire core.

## Key Points

- This PHP style guide represents the coding style preferred for the ProcessWire core.
- It is also recommended (though certainly not required) for 3rd party modules and other code using the ProcessWire API, unless an existing coding standard is already in place or preferred. Use of this coding standard is however requested for code submissions (pull requests) to the ProcessWire core.
- The ProcessWire coding style guide is based on PSR-1 and PSR-2 (with many sections copied directly from them), but with several important differences and additions. Read more in our Introduction to the ProcessWire Coding Style Guide.
