Source: https://processwire.com/docs/tutorials/hello-worlds/

## Summary

In this tutorial you will learn how to create and work with templates, fields, pages, and how to output dynamic data via your templates.

## Key Points

- In this tutorial you will learn how to create and work with templates, fields, pages, and how to output dynamic data via your templates.
- This tutorial plays on the 'hello world' phrase and lists information about planets in the solar system, starting with Earth. To keep it simple, we'll assume that the basic site profile is installed, as that's what comes with ProcessWire (so there's no need to uninstall anything). But we won't start using any of it's files at this stage. Instead, we'll start out by creating our own files.
- After completing this tutorial you will have learned how to create and work with templates, fields, pages, and how to output dynamic data via your templates.

### Step 1 – Create a template file

Create a new file called: /site/templates/planet.php, and copy+paste the following HTML into that file:


## Create a Template and a Page


### Step 2 – Add a template to ProcessWire


### Step 3 – Creating a page using your template

Your planet template is now in the system and ready to use, but it's not being used by any pages. So lets create a page that uses the planet template.


## Setting up Custom Fields


### Step 4 – Creating a new field

Now you know how to create a template and a page using that template. You could create more pages using the same template if you wanted to. But that wouldn't be particularly useful – this template file is just a static HTML file.


### Step 5 – Creating more new fields

In step 4 we created the planet_type field. Now we want to create the planet_age and planet_summary fields. So in this step, you'll want to do the same thing for the remaining two fields:


### Step 6 – Adding new fields to your template

Now that you've created 3 new fields, you need to add them to your planet template.
