Multi-language page names (URLs) and multi-language text fields make developing a multilingual site as easy as developing a single language site. 

ProcessWire's multi-language support includes a full gettext-style [translation system](/docs/multi-language-support/code-i18n/), but with the translation tools built into the CMS, and without actually using gettext. You can also install (or create) alternate language packs for the admin side of ProcessWire.

Multi-language support is installed with core modules available in the admin: Modules > Language > Language Support. If you just want to install alternate language packs, then all you need is the base *Language Support* module. If you want to support multi-language fields in your own site, then you should also install the *Language Support Fields* module. We also recommend installing *Language Support Page Names* module for multi-language URLs*. *
