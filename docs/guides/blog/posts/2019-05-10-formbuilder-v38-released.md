## FormBuilder v38 released

10 May 2019 by Ryan Cramer [ 2 Comments](/blog/posts/formbuilder-v38-released/#comments)

In this week’s post we’ll shift focus a bit and take a look at the latest version of FormBuilder (v38) just released today. It ends up being a fairly major release with a lot of new additions, optimizations and updates.

This version of [FormBuilder](https://processwire.com/store/form-builder/) is now ProcessWire 3.x native so likewise requires a ProcessWire 3.x version (3.0.123 or newer recommended). This version also includes the optional Stripe Payment for FormBuilder module. Current FormBuilder subscribers can download this latest version, as well as the Stripe payment module, from the FormBuilder support board download thread.

This week I also put quite a bit of work into the new RepeaterMatrix version. It's not quite ready this week, but could be as soon as next week. The new version focuses primarily in implementing the queue of requested features from the RepeaterMatrix support board. Next week I'll be back with a new core version (3.0.132) and hoping to get Horst's new webp support added as well. Until then, hope that you have a great weekend and week ahead, and enjoy reading the [ProcessWire Weekly](https://weekly.pw) this weekend!
