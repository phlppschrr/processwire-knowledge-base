## ProcessWire 3.0.97 core updates

30 March 2018 by Ryan Cramer [ 2 Comments](/blog/posts/processwire-3.0.97-core-updates/#comments)

This is an extra short blog post so that I can make a reasonably sized screenshot.

New on the dev branch this week is ProcessWire 3.0.97. The main difference between this version and 3.0.96 master is that 3.0.97 contains bug fixes for various minor things. There's nothing major here, so if you are already running 3.0.96 master without issue, it's perfectly fine to wait until this version hits the master branch. That'll likely be a week from now as version 3.0.98. But if you like to run on the dev branch with the latest version, then 3.0.97 is worth upgrading to, as always. At present, the master and dev branches are equally stable, and that'll likely be the case until we get back into adding-features mode.


### Upcoming attractions

For whatever reason, the electricity (and internet) has been on and off today, so I'm going to keep this post short. But next week I'll have a post that covers version 3.0.98 (likely master) and also introduces a version of ProCache (3.1.8) with a new feature, buster. No I'm not calling you buster, I mean the feature is called “buster”, as in a browser cache, buster.

Over the next couple of weeks I plan to continue working on master branch updates, and then we'll get a closer look at recent PRs for inclusion on the dev branch. We'll take a break at version 3.0.100 (or thereabouts) to focus on redoing this website that you are reading now. We are long overdue for a new site, and we may need some of your skills and expertise too, we can talk more on that soon. But once we've got a new site, ProcessWire 3.1 will likely follow soon after. There's lots of good stuff on the way.

Thanks for reading! Have a great weekend and keep up-to-date at [ProcessWire Weekly](http://weekly.pw).
