## Inline ajax page editing comes to ListerPro

## ProcessWire 2.6.6

This week (actually, the last few weeks) we've updated [ListerPro](/api/modules/lister-pro/) to support inline ajax editing for any page and just about any Fieldtype. After using it here this week, I have to be honest and say I think this is a pretty revolutionary new way to edit pages in ProcessWire.

This was not my idea (I always thought it would be near impossible to implement), so thanks to the people that have been requesting this feature! Not only was it possible to implement, but it's been taken a lot farther than you might think. You can do things like ajax uploads, autocomplete, and more, for example. All while having all of the existing Lister and ListerPro features at your disposal.

The ProcessWire core required several updates in order to support this, so the latest dev version is now 2.6.6 and this version is required by the latest ListerPro. Specifically, most of the core Inputfields were updated to support dynamic ajax insertion and save. The usefulness of this may go well beyond ListerPro in the future.

I'll be wrapping it up and posting to the ListerPro board later this evening (edit: now posted in the [ListerPro support board](/talk/topic/10279-new-listerpro-103-with-editable-columns-support/)). Actually, I left myself no time for writing a proper post about it. So here are a few screenshots below that help to describe what it does.
