# $page->numChildren($selector = null): int

Source: `wire/core/Page.php`

Return number of all children, optionally with conditions

Use this over the `$page->numChildren` property when you want to specify a selector, or when you want the result to
include only visible children. See the options for the $selector argument.

When you want to retrieve all children with no exclusions or conditions, use the `$page->numChildren` property instead.

## Example

~~~~~
// Find how many children were modified in the last week
$qty = $page->numChildren("modified>='-1 WEEK'");
~~~~~

## Usage

~~~~~
// basic usage
$int = $page->numChildren();

// usage with all arguments
$int = $page->numChildren($selector = null);
~~~~~

## Arguments

- `$selector` (optional) `bool|string|array` - When not specified, result includes all children without conditions, same as $page->numChildren property. - When a string or array, a selector is assumed and quantity will be counted based on selector. - When boolean true, number includes only visible children (excludes unpublished, hidden, no-access, etc.) - When boolean false, number includes all children without conditions, including unpublished, hidden, no-access, etc. - When integer 1 number includes “viewable” children (as opposed to “visible” children, viewable children includes hidden pages and also includes unpublished pages if user has page-edit permission).

## Return value

- `int` Number of children
