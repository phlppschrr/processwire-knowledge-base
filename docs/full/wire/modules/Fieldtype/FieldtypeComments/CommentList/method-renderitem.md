# CommentList::renderItem()

Render the comment

This is the default rendering for development/testing/demonstration purposes

It may be used for production, but only if it meets your needs already. Typically you'll want to render the comments
using your own code in your templates.

@param Comment $comment

@param array $options

@return string

@see CommentArray::render()
